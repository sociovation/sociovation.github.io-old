                        <p class="text-muted">"A child without education is like a bird without wings" ~ Believing in the same ideology, the centre for social innovation chooses " Child Education and development " as one of the key areas to work upon.
Education is the basic human right and a significant factor in the development of children. It creates awareness and expands one's vision. Moreover, opening classroom doors to all the children will also break the intergenerational chains of poverty because education is intrinsically linked to all the development goals.
Children of the underprivileged sections of the society have a desire to study, but unfortunately they are deprived of the resources and don't have access to any such means. So, efforts are being made by the team members to promote education for these underprivileged children. Workshops regarding the importance of education  are organised, teaching sessions are arranged for the children of nearby slums. Regular classes for these children will also be held in the college campus itself.
The unparalleled combination of bounteous energy and unrelenting dedication shown by the members is sure to bring  a change in the society."</p>

                        <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">

We are driven by the vision of a world where all women – in particular women from underprivileged backgrounds – enjoy full citizenship, earn a livelihood with dignity and generate wealth and value for all.<br><br>

 



Our mission is to equip resource-poor women with knowledge and skills so that they excel as professionals and entrepreneurs, and earn a “livelihood with dignity” in jobs and markets that had traditionally been closed to them.
We believe that when women are socially and economically empowered, they become catalysts of change – not just in their own lives, but also in their families and communities.
We work with resource-poor women to enable them to:<br><br>

·         imagine new roles for themselves
·         get opportunities to work in safe and respectful environments.<br>
·         enhance not just their economic status but also their self-respect and dignity<br>
·         build social capital as they transform their lives and lives of people around them.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-muted">Lit the lamp of cleanliness to spread the light of godliness.Believing in this idealogy,the Centre for
Social Innovation tries to put forth before society its views and style of working. Keeping our home
clean doesnt imply that everything is clean. It is the combination of people who form the society
and its the society which forms the nation. Cleanliness is required from individual level to the
societal level. Access to clean place, clean water and an area which is full of greenery is the prime
objective. Accompalishing this level of achievement isnt easy but the motivated students are toiling
hard to achieve some percent change in the society.Regular workshops and visits to different places
are being done in order to have a deeper insight about the society. The mission, vision of the centre
is to set a mark in the society which is followed by every individual in order to uplift the society.
Living in the clean and green environment is a basic necessity which everyone aspire of. Keeping
this in mind the Centre will try to mould the society in such a way that every aspiration is achieved.</p>
